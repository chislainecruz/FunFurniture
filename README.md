## Place 3D objects around you

This project was created with the vision of placing furniture in your house to see what they look like prior purchase. 
The benefit of this is that customers can proceed to place an order for items that don't yet exist, which saves vendors time, money, and space. Users also save time and money because they dont have to purchase items online without knowing how it will look or fit at home.
It can also be adapted for clothing, jewelry and accessories with 3D models.
